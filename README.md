# Name-Generator
The project is an LSTM model trained on a small dataset of 3000 names (names.txt). Model generates names from model by selecting one out of top 3 letters suggested by model at a time until an EOS (End Of Sentence) character is not encountered. <br>
<b>Input for the model is any letter than you want the suggested names to start from.<b><br>
Output are the 20 names generated by model.<br>
